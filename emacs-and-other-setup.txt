NB: there is another file somewhere I have for what I did to install stuff on this macbook, (maybe it's a .sh script now that I think of it), having this one since I can't find it - to be merged somehow later
atow what this file will have is commands/how I'm installing emacs, and maybe other stuff related to the haskell and ocaml etc learning I'm doing now, or things I'm installing on comp in general

brew install emacs


https://ocaml.org/install#linux_mac_bsd


npm i -g prettier


local tunneling stuff

brew install cloudflared

npm i beeceptor-cli -g
